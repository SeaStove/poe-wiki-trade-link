# PoE Wiki Trade Link

**Description:** This extension adds a button to the [Path of Exile (PoE) Wiki](https://poewiki.net/) page to quickly open a [PoE trade](https://www.pathofexile.com/trade) search page for a specific item. It allows you to seamlessly transition from researching an item on the PoE Wiki to finding it on the PoE trade platform.
